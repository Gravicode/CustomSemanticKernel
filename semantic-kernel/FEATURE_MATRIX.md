# Design Choices

The overall architecture of the core kernel is consistent across all languages,
however, the code follows common paradigms and style of each language.

During the initial development phase, many Python best practices have been ignored
in the interest of velocity and feature parity. The project is now going through
a refactoring exercise to increase code quality.

To make the SDK as lightweight as possible, the core packages have
a minimal set of external dependencies.
